# Just My Type
## A tool for making typeface combinations.

I really like good typeface combinations. I mean... I _like-like_ them. 

I want to see them everywhere I go on the internet. So I developed a simple tool to help people make type combinations. It's really basic. For now. You can see the live demo [here](https://luciannovo.github.io)
